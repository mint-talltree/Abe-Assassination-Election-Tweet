# Abe-Assassination-Election-Tweet
Methodology of Twitter scraping specifically for Japanese tweets related to 2022 Japanese House of Councillors Election immediately before and after Former Prime Minister Abe's assassination.

This relies heavily on JustAnotherArchivist's snscrape (https://github.com/JustAnotherArchivist/snscrape) and was based on the tutorial and code provided by 2022/snscrape/tweets.py

Due to Twitter policy changes, as detailed in https://github.com/JustAnotherArchivist/snscrape/issues/996, this code does not work as of July 27 2023.
